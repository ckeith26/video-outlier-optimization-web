# Frontend Starter Pack

*description*

## What Worked Well

1. Checklist: 
    - [X]  vite dev server starts and serves pages
    - [X]  eslint is configured - it complains if there is bad code / autocorrects indents etc
    - [X]  webpage displays and counts seconds
    - [X]  image displays and is loaded via vite
    - [X]  js is linted without errors!
2. A short answer response in a comment on the feedback pull request in github: 
    - describe the environment you set up.
    I setup the frontend starter pack using vite. I also installed eslint, nvm, and tailwindcss and favicon plugins.  
    - any questions about what/why/how that you feel are unresolved?
    I don't have any questions at this time.
    
## What Didn't

## Extra Credit

- installed nvm
- added tailwindcss plugin
- added favicon plugin
